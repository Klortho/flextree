# Test cases

* 1-5 are from random trees generated by the code
* 6 is a representation of a problem I was having with my implementation of
  "flextree". It works here.
* 7-8 - from Figure 6 of "Drawing Non-layered Tidy Trees in Linear Time".
  before-7.json is from the figure, and before-8.json is its mirror image,
  illustrating that the algorithm satisfies aesthetic 5.
